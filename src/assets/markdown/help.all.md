Hi, I'm GameMakerBot. Here are my available commands:
```
!help      - outputs this message

!role      - toggles a role on and off
             usage: !role [role]
             available roles: 'voip'

!resources - outputs a list of trusted resources to assist with your GameMaker Studio journey

!docs      - outputs the URL to the documentation of a GML function
             usage: !docs [function_name] [optional: version]
             available versions: 'gms1','gms2'; defaults to 'gms2'
             example: !docs draw_sprite
             example: !docs draw_sprite gms2
             example: !docs draw_sprite gms1

I can also assist you with your code formatting and auto generate GMLive snippets for you.
